RubyGems C Extension Example
----------------------------

This is an example C extension that accompanies the [Gems with
Extensions](http://guides.rubygems.org/gems-with-extensions) guide on
http://guides.rubygems.org.

To compile and test the extension:

    gem install rake-compiler

    rake

This example gem contains comments that are not present in the guide that would
be distracting if mixed in with the guide text.  I recommend you at least
glance through each of the four files in the gem.
